Hey Folks! Welcome to my page.

I am currently pursuing Ph.D. from the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) (Powai, India). The broad area of my research is Modeling, Simulation and Optimization. My research work is funded by [FOSSEE](https://fossee.in) project where I also work as a Project Manager. The FOSSEE project is part of the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India. My Ph.D. work is guided by Prof. Kannan Moudgalya and Prof. Sanjay Mahajani.

## My background and history
I recieved my B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from [School of Chemical and Biotechnology](https://scbt.sastra.edu/) at the [SASTRA Deemed University](https://www.sastra.edu/). I have completed my higher secondary education from Vignan Vidyalayam Junior College, Visakhapatnam(A.P) and schooling from D.A.V. Public School, Pandaveswar(W.B). After completing my B.Tech from SASTRA Deemed University, I joined IBM India Pvt. Ltd. as a Associate System Engineer. After working there for about 13 months, I joined the [FOSSEE](https://fossee.in) project under the guidance of Prof. Kannan Moudgalya. At FOSSEE, I was first a Project Research Assistant, then Assistant Project Manager and then became a Project Manager. My research work has been in the area of Modeling and Simulation using Free and Open Source Softwares like [DWSIM](https://dwsim.fossee.in) and [OpenModelica](https://om.fossee.in). For my research work, I got awarded as Outstanding Young Chemical Engineer(OYCE-2020) in the working professional category by [Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers](http://iichemrc.org/) IIChE-MRC.
