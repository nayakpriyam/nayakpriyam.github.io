Hey Folks! Welcome to my page.

I am currently pursuing Ph.D. from the [Department of Chemical Engineering](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) (Powai, India), with a focus on Modeling, Simulation, and Optimization. Specifically, I am delving into the captivating realm of Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Units (FCCU). Guided by the brilliant minds of Prof. Kannan Moudgalya and Prof. Sanjay Mahajani, I am passionately exploring innovative approaches to enhance efficiency and performance within this field. My research work is funded by [FOSSEE](https://fossee.in) project where I also work as a Project Manager. The FOSSEE project is part of the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India. Through my research work, I aim to contribute to the advancement of knowledge and make a positive impact on the industry.

I recieved my B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from [School of Chemical and Biotechnology](https://scbt.sastra.edu/) at the [SASTRA Deemed University](https://www.sastra.edu/). I have completed my higher secondary education from Vignan Vidyalayam Junior College, Visakhapatnam(A.P) and schooling from D.A.V. Public School, Pandaveswar(W.B). After completing my B.Tech from SASTRA Deemed University, I joined IBM India Pvt. Ltd. as a Associate System Engineer. After working there for about 13 months, I joined the [FOSSEE](https://fossee.in) project under the guidance of Prof. Kannan Moudgalya. At FOSSEE, I was first a Project Research Assistant, then Assistant Project Manager and then became a Project Manager. My research work has been in the area of Modeling and Simulation using Free and Open Source Softwares like [DWSIM](https://dwsim.fossee.in) and [OpenModelica](https://om.fossee.in). For my research work, I got awarded as Outstanding Young Chemical Engineer(OYCE-2020) in the working professional category by [Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers](http://iichemrc.org/) IIChE-MRC.

## My background and history
My journey in Chemical Engineering began with a B.Tech degree from [School of Chemical and Biotechnology](https://scbt.sastra.edu/) at the [SASTRA Deemed University](https://www.sastra.edu/). Following my graduation, I gained valuable experience as an Associate System Engineer at IBM India Pvt. Ltd., where I honed my skills in problem-solving and teamwork. However, my passion for research and innovation led me to join the [FOSSEE](https://fossee.in) project at IIT Bombay, where I started as a Project Research Assistant and progressed to become an Assistant Project Manager and eventually a Project Manager. Within the FOSSEE project, I have leveraged my expertise in Free and Open Source Software, utilizing tools such as [DWSIM](https://dwsim.fossee.in) and [OpenModelica](https://om.fossee.in) for Modeling and Simulation purposes. I am proud to have been recognized as an Outstanding Young Chemical Engineer (OYCE-2020) in the working professional category by the [Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers](http://iichemrc.org/) IIChE-MRC. As I continue to grow and learn, I am eager to connect with fellow professionals and explore collaborative opportunities that will drive advancements in the fascinating world of Chemical Engineering.
