The equation-oriented general-purpose simulator OpenModelica provides a convenient, extendible modeling environment, with capabilities such as an easy switch from steady-state to dynamic simulations. This work reports the creation of a library of steady-state models of unit operations using OpenModelica. The use of this library is demonstrated through a few representative flowsheets, and the results are compared with the steady-state simulators Aspen Plus and DWSIM. Being open-source and supported by a large community of developers across the world, OpenModelica provides a convenient platform to train a large number of chemical engineers to increase collaborative research and employment.
